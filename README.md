# Module-52465---Programming-for-Data-Analysis---Project
## 10 Credit Module Project 2018 – 50% of overall mark for this module 

### Deadline: December 14th (Friday)

#### Project instructions;

*The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook.*

I initially began brainstorming some ideas for a real-world phenomenon;
One of the requirements is it must be measured, and I need to be able to collect at least one-hundred data points across four different variables.

I recently adopted a rescue puppy, and when I read the description of this project I immediately thought about different dog breeds, and their relation to being adopted from animal shelters. This seems like something there should be a lot of data on, so I decided to base my project on this topic and investigate online. The four different variables could be four different dog breeds. 

### My research on my chosen topic:

I adopted my puppy, Tyson, from MADRA in August of this year after our family dog, Bailey, passed away.

I wasn’t certain what type of dog I wanted to adopt. I knew I would prefer a puppy, as then I would have the experience of raising him/her from a young age. My boyfriend and I contacted MADRA, and they advised us to send in an application so they could complete a home inspection, etc. We also contacted the GSPCA who advised that they would not allow us to adopt a puppy as there was not always guaranteed to be someone at home 24/7 in our house.

We visited MADRA several times, and walked lots of their dogs who ranged in age from 1 year to approximately 10 years old, but they had no puppies on any of the occasions we visited the shelter.

We continued to contact the kind people who work at MADRA regularly so that we would be updated when any puppies arrived at the shelter, and eventually we were informed that two pitbull-cross puppies had arrived in need of a good home. We knew we could not adopt two puppies, but the staff at MADRA advised us that it was not a requirement that the puppies be rehomed together, as was the case for some of their other candidates.

I visited their website while completing this project, but could not locate any information or figures on the amount of dogs they rehome each year. 


#### Some findings from my research;

I decided to Google ‘Ireland Dog Adoption Figures’.

According to the ISPCA website ‘there has been a steady increase of dog adoptions, 30 dogs are still abandoned each day in Ireland.’ I was happy to see that there is an increase in dog adoptions. I thought this may be of interest in terms of data for this project. ‘Recent statistics released by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government have shown that there has been a steady increase in the number of dog adoptions since the Pedigree Adoption Drive first launched 6 years ago. In 2008, a startling 10,094 dogs died in Irish pounds while in 2012 4,500 dogs died in shelters nationwide.’

I learned from The Journal.ie that;
‘The latest dog control report released by the Department of Rural and Community Development, suggests that 916 dogs, not counting registered greyhounds) were put to sleep in Irish pounds in 2017, a 40% reduction from the 1,522 strays who suffered the same fate the previous year.

Meanwhile, 11,559 dogs entered Irish pounds last year, an 8% drop from the 12,549 who entered such institutions in 2016.

Dogs Trust also drew particular attention to the issues facing registered greyhounds in Ireland. Last year saw a 15% increase on the number of such greyhounds entering pounds. Of those 215, 180 were surrendered by their owners, and 80 (37%) were destroyed.’ 
This was interesting to me – it seems that the breed of the dog (in the case of greyhounds) has an impact on the amount which enter pounds.

I downloaded and reviewed the latest dog control report (https://drcd.gov.ie/dog-control/view-our-dog-control-statistics/). I initially thought I might use this as a guide and simulate figures based on the actual figures from this report for the purpose of this project, but as my project evolved I didn’t end up going that route.

#### My repository contains;

A dataset which simulates the real-world phenomenon of different variables which impact dog adoption rates.
